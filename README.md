# üì± SMS Spam Text Classification

A deep learning-based binary text classifier that identifies whether an incoming SMS message is **spam** or **ham (not spam)**. This project leverages TensorFlow and NLP techniques to create a robust and scalable message filtering system.

## üîç Problem Statement

SMS spam is a major issue, often containing malicious content or wasting user time. This project aims to build a model that classifies SMS messages as spam or ham using supervised learning techniques on a real-world dataset.

## üöÄ Project Overview

- Loaded and explored a labeled SMS dataset.
- Preprocessed the text data using TensorFlow's TextVectorization layer.
- Built and trained a deep learning model using Keras Sequential API.
- Evaluated the model using standard metrics and visualized training performance.

## üìÇ Dataset

- Format: `.tsv` (Tab-separated values)
- Total messages: ~5,500
- Labels: `spam` and `ham`
- Source: [FreeCodeCamp GitHub - SMS Dataset](https://github.com/beaucarnes/fcc_python_curriculum/blob/master/sms/)

## üß† Model Architecture

The model uses the following architecture:

- `TextVectorization` layer for converting raw text to integer sequences
- `Embedding` layer to learn word embeddings during training
- `GlobalAveragePooling1D` layer to reduce dimensionality
- `Dense` hidden layer with ReLU activation
- Output layer with a sigmoid activation for binary classification
